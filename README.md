### Hi there, I'm Paul Kirkpatrick.

I'm a Full stack developer that isn't sure whether he likes front-end or back-end development more. I live and work in the Wichita area in Kansas, and I recently finished an extensive Full Stack Development Boot Camp with the University of Kansas. Currently, I'm exploring new opportunities and ideas.

# Current Projects

My brother's plumbing business paid someone $50 almost ten years ago to build them a website on Wordpress. It looks...like someone paid a guy $50 to build them a website ten years ago, honeslty. Right now, we're going over the design and user experience for a new one. I think it's about time.
