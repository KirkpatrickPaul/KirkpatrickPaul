### Hi there, I'm Paul Kirkpatrick.

Collaborative environments are where I shine. I enjoy working on strange scenarios or exploring new technologies. Automation and Optimization are things I've enjoyed since before I knew the words for them. When a problem has no solution, I love to get creative.

I'm a full stack developer that has experience with many different frameworks and libraries. I currently am proficient in Javascript, Python, SQL, and Dart, but I would love to explore new languages, too!

# Current Projects

My brother's plumbing business paid someone $50 almost ten years ago to build them a website on Wordpress. It looks...like someone paid a guy $50 to build them a website ten years ago, honestly. Right now, we're going over the design and user experience for a new one. I think it's about time.
